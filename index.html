    <td>Artist Statement 1: When creating this animal I wanted to combine some of my favorite animals. So off the top of my head, I chose 3 animals to create a new improved weirdly cute animal. My animal looks like it would have some sort of cute magical power. I combined a cat, bunny, and a butterfly together by using the brush tool to erase the parts I dont need and put the parts together. </td>
    <td>Artist Statement 2: This week in class we learned about Pixels and 8-bit designing, so for our projects you were tasked with designing your very own custom character and environment for them to live. I used the brush and eraser tools by creating a really beautiful gradient background then i used the pencil tool to create my pixel art. I started by making the background 50 by 72 boxes and from there i started on my art piece. My character looks like a ginger cat! My favorite. My character would be in a game where yo could build and design your world. Any world you want. Their purpose in the game would be to create a relaxing space where the player can express themselves. </td>
    <td>Artist Statement 3: I used the image that I changed from pexel, I basically just flipped the image over in different ways and duplicated it. I put a filter over my picture to change its apperence. Slowly the picture of the fall leaves turned into a kaleidoscope and the image looked like the leaves were spinning to the ground. I loved that the color orange was very prominent and had a nice representation of fall in a beautiful way. </td>
